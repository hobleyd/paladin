Paladin, an eLibrary for your eBooks, optimised for eInk screens.
===========================================================================

Paladin is built to be your eLibrary rather than just an eReader and allows the scalable management of your Book
collection. It will manage thousands of books quickly and easily and allow you to browse you collection by Title,
Author, Calibre Tag and Series.

It displays the current series on a shelf which allows you to quickly see where you are up to. As long as Calibre
has the metadata for the series, the books will be displayed in series order and flag those that have been read
and those that haven't.

Any Books with a tag "Future Reads" are available in the Flagged Books screen, available from the waffle button.
It also records your reading history so you can see what you have read previously.

It has been optimised for e-Ink devices as well as running on supported Flutter targets.

Paladin is licensed under the GPL-V3 license.

-------

Paladin uses it's own Web Services to connect to your Calibre database. You'll need to install those as well
to get access to your library from anywhere in the world.

This is developed within Android Studio and it is highly recommended to open the project up in that
application.
